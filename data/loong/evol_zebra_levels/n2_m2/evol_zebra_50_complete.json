Let's parse it carefully.\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks **neither juice nor tea** immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   Since the only beverages are tea and juice, \"neither juice nor tea\" means the painting person drinks **neither tea nor juice** \u2014 but these are the only beverages, so this is impossible.\n\n   This suggests the clue might be parsed incorrectly.\n\n   Let's re-express the clue:\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice nor tea **immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.**\n\n   The phrase \"immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea\" modifies the painting person.\n\n   So the painting person is immediately to the right of the tea drinker.\n\n   The painting person drinks neither juice nor tea.\n\n   But the only beverages are tea and juice, so this is impossible.\n\n   So maybe the clue is ambiguous or missing punctuation.\n\n   Another way to parse:\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice, nor tea immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   This is ambiguous.\n\n   Could it mean:\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice, nor tea immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   Or\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice, nor tea, and is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   The second interpretation makes more sense.\n\n   So:\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice nor tea.\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   But again, the only beverages are tea and juice, so \"neither juice nor tea\" is impossible.\n\n   So maybe the clue means:\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice.\n\n   - The person who enjoys painting is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   That is, the painting person drinks tea (since only tea and juice are available, and \"neither juice\" means tea).\n\n   So the painting person drinks tea.\n\n   And the painting person is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   That would mean the painting person drinks tea and is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n   That can't be, because no two people can share the same beverage.\n\n   So this is impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Let's try to rewrite the clue as:\n\n- The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice.\n\n- The person who enjoys painting is immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\nSo the painting person drinks tea (since only tea and juice are available, and \"neither juice\" means tea).\n\nThe painting person is immediately to the right of the tea drinker.\n\nBut the tea drinker and the painting person can't be the same person (since the painting person is to the right of the tea drinker).\n\nSo two people:\n\n- Person at position 0 drinks tea.\n\n- Person at position 1 enjoys painting and drinks tea.\n\nImpossible, because tea can't be repeated.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion: The clue must mean:\n\n- The person who enjoys painting drinks neither juice nor tea immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea.\n\n- The phrase \"immediately to the right of the person who drinks tea\" modifies the painting person.\n\n- The painting person drinks neither juice nor tea.\n\n- Since only tea and juice are available, this is impossible.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative interpretation:\n\nMaybe",

Cuisine: Japanese, Mexican  \n2. Tool: wok, blender\n\nEach category has exactly 2 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. The chef who uses the blender is immediately to the left of the Japanese cuisine specialist.\n\nThe puzzle has these categories and items:\nCategories: ['Cuisine', 'Tool']\nItems: {'Cuisine': ['Japanese', 'Mexican'], 'Tool': ['wok', 'blender']}\n\nRequirements:\n1. Use 'from constraint import Problem, AllDifferentConstraint'\n2. Create variables for each item with positions 0,1\n3. Add AllDifferentConstraint for each category\n4. Parse the clue and add appropriate constraint\n5. Return solution as dictionary format\n\nTemplate:\n```python\nfrom constraint import Problem, AllDifferentConstraint\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    problem = Problem()\n    \n    categories = ['Cuisine', 'Tool']\n    items = {'Cuisine': ['Japanese', 'Mexican'], 'Tool': ['wok', 'blender']}\n    \n    # Add variables\n    for category in categories:\n        for item in items[category]:\n            var_name = f\"{category}:{item}\"\n            problem.addVariable(var_name, [0, 1])\n    \n    # Category constraints\n    for category in categories:\n        cat_vars = [f\"{category}:{item}\" for item in items[category]]\n        problem.addConstraint(AllDifferentConstraint(), cat_vars)\n    \n    # Add clue constraint here based on the specific clue\n    # [ANALYZE THE CLUE AND ADD APPROPRIATE CONSTRAINT]\n    \n    solutions = problem.getSolutions()\n    if len(solutions) != 1:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Expected 1 solution, got {len(solutions)}\")\n    \n    solution = solutions[0]\n    result = {}\n    for category in categories:\n        result[category] = [\"\", \"\"]\n        for item in items[category]:\n            pos = solution[f\"{category}:{item}\"]\n            result[category][pos] = item\n    \n    return result\n\nprint(solve_puzzle())\n```\n\nGenerate the complete working code with the correct constraint for the clue.

So clue 1 satisfied.\n- Clue 2: Artist at 0 is to the left of tea at 1 \u2192 clue 2 satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n```python\n{\n  \"Profession\": [\"artist\", \"engineer\"],\n  \"Favorite Drink\": [\"lemonade\", \"tea\"]\n}\n```",

By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 2 unique items:\n\n1. Profession: architect, musician  \n2. Favorite fruit: mango, blueberry\n\nEach category has exactly 2 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. The person who prefers mango is not standing at the leftmost position.  \n2. The architect is immediately to the right of the person who likes blueberry.  \n3. The musician does not like mango.\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:  \n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Profession\", \"Favorite fruit\").  \n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 2).  \n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n\nThe puzzle has these categories and items:\nCategories: ['Profession', 'Favorite fruit']\nItems: {'Profession': ['architect', 'musician'], 'Favorite fruit': ['mango', 'blueberry']}\n\nRequirements:\n1. Use 'from constraint import Problem, AllDifferentConstraint'\n2. Create variables for each item with positions 0,1\n3. Add AllDifferentConstraint for each category\n4. Parse the clue and add appropriate constraint\n5.
