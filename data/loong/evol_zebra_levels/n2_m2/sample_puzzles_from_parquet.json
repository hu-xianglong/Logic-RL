In this puzzle, there are 2 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 2 different categories (such as profession, favorite fruit, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example, \"the person who is a painter lives immediately to the right of the person who prefers apples.\" By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 2 unique items:\n\n1. Profession: baker, gardener  \n2. Favorite Fruit: mango, kiwi  \n\nEach category has exactly 2 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1.
