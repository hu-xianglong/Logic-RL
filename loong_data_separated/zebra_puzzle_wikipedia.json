    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 3 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Job: project-manager, dancer, coach, firefighter, architect\n2. Beverage: soy-milk, mirinda, water, fanta, coffee\n3. Hobby: camping, traveling, gardening, woodworking, drawing\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who likes soy-milk is the same person as the person who enjoys camping\n2. the person who works as a architect is immediately to the left of the person who works as a dancer\n3. the person who enjoys gardening is immediately to the right of the person who works as a dancer\n4. the person who likes water is adjacent to the person who likes soy-milk (either immediately left or right)\n5. the person who works as a dancer is the same person as the person who enjoys woodworking\n6. the person who works as a coach is a different person than the person who likes coffee\n7. the person who enjoys gardening is to the left of the person who works as a coach (not necessarily immediately)\n8. the person who works as a project-manager is to the right of the person who enjoys traveling (not necessarily immediately)\n9. the person who works as a dancer is the same person as the person who likes mirinda\n10. the person who likes soy-milk is to the left of the person who enjoys traveling (not necessarily immediately)\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Beverage\", \"Hobby\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 3 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Hobby: rock-climbing, woodworking, writing, magic-tricks, traveling\n2. Movie: family, superhero, adventure, musical, epic\n3. Job: journalist, photographer, mechanic, manager, doctor\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who likes epic movies is adjacent to the person who likes musical movies (either immediately left or right)\n2. the person who works as a doctor is to the left of the person who works as a mechanic (not necessarily immediately)\n3. the person who works as a journalist is adjacent to the person who likes adventure movies (either immediately left or right)\n4. the person who enjoys traveling is immediately to the left of the person who likes family movies\n5. the person who enjoys magic-tricks is immediately to the right of the person who enjoys rock-climbing\n6. the person who likes musical movies is to the right of the person who works as a photographer (not necessarily immediately)\n7. the person who works as a photographer is to the right of the person who enjoys woodworking (not necessarily immediately)\n8. the person who enjoys writing is a different person than the person who works as a journalist\n9. the person who likes family movies is at an odd-numbered position\n10. the person who works as a doctor is immediately to the left of the person who enjoys woodworking\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Hobby\", \"Job\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 4 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 4 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 4 unique items:\n\n1. Food: pomegranate, grapefruit, broccoli, radish\n2. Sport: soccer, swimming, biathlon, handball\n3. Hobby: traveling, card-games, woodworking, writing\n4.

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'.

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'.

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Hobby: card-games, writing, cooking, video-games, drawing\n2. Transport: boat, trike, scooter, skateboard, roller\n3. Sport: skateboarding, sailing, weightlifting, handball, swimming\n4. Pet: rabbit, pony, bird, goat, dog\n5. Nationality: japanese, dutch, thai, indonesian, nigerian\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the nigerian person is the same person as exactly one of the person who enjoys cooking or the person who plays swimming\n2. the dutch person is the same person as the person who uses boat for transportation or the person who plays weightlifting is the same person as the dutch person, but not both\n3. the person who enjoys drawing is the same person as the person who has dog as a pet or the indonesian person is the same person as the person who enjoys drawing, but not both\n4. the person who uses skateboard for transportation is at the same position as or to the right of the nigerian person\n5. the person who has pony as a pet is at the same position as or to the left of the person who has dog as a pet\n6. the person who enjoys writing is at the same position as or to the left of the person who enjoys writing\n7. the person who uses roller for transportation is the same person as the person who enjoys cooking or the person who enjoys cooking is the same person as the indonesian person or both\n8. the person who uses trike for transportation is at the same position as or to the left of the person who plays skateboarding\n9. the person who plays handball is somewhere between the japanese person and the person who has pony as a pet (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n10. the person who enjoys writing and the person who has pony as a pet are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n11. the person who uses roller for transportation is at the same position as or to the right of the person who uses scooter for transportation\n12. the person who has rabbit as a pet is at the same position as or to the right of the nigerian person\n13. the person who uses boat for transportation is somewhere between the nigerian person and the person who enjoys writing (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n14. the person who enjoys video-games is the same person as the person who uses boat for transportation or the person who uses boat for transportation is the same person as the person who plays weightlifting, but not both\n15. the person who uses scooter for transportation is at the same position as or to the right of the indonesian person\n16. the person who enjoys writing is a different person than at least one of the japanese person or the person who uses scooter for transportation\n17. the person who uses roller for transportation is at the same position as or to the right of the person who enjoys writing\n18. the person who has goat as a pet is at the same position as or to the right of the person who has rabbit as a pet\n19. the person who plays weightlifting is somewhere between the person who plays swimming and the person who plays sailing (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n20. the person who enjoys cooking and the thai person are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n21. the person who uses scooter for transportation is somewhere between the indonesian person and the person who has bird as a pet (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n22. the person who uses trike for transportation is a different person than the person who plays swimming or the person who plays swimming is a different person than the person who has pony as a pet or both\n23. the person who has goat as a pet is at the same position as or to the left of the person who has goat as a pet\n24. the person who plays weightlifting is at the same position as or to the left of the person who uses scooter for transportation\n25. the person who enjoys writing and the person who has goat as a pet are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n26. the person who has goat as a pet is at the same position as or to the right of the nigerian person\n27. the person who plays weightlifting is a different person than the japanese person or the person who enjoys video-games is a different person than the person who plays weightlifting or both\n28. the person who uses skateboard for transportation is a different person than at least one of the person who enjoys card-games or the nigerian person\n29. the person who has rabbit as a pet and the person who uses boat for transportation are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Hobby\", \"Nationality\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 4 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Job: entrepreneur, architect, firefighter, bartender, designer\n2. Movie: zombie, spy, crime, sports, family\n3. Food: corn, grapes, eggplant, kale, papaya\n4. Hobby: collecting, photography, camping, traveling, card-games\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who works as a architect is at position 1 (the leftmost position)\n2. the person who likes eggplant is the same person as the person who enjoys traveling\n3. the person who works as a entrepreneur is immediately to the left of the person who likes kale\n4. the person who works as a designer and the person who likes sports movies are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n5. the person who works as a firefighter is adjacent to the person who enjoys collecting (either immediately left or right)\n6. the person who likes zombie movies is immediately to the left of the person who likes spy movies\n7. the person who works as a designer is the same person as the person who likes eggplant\n8. the person who likes family movies is to the right of the person who likes crime movies (not necessarily immediately)\n9. the person who enjoys traveling is somewhere between the person who likes family movies and the person who likes corn (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n10. the person who enjoys card-games is at the same position as or to the left of the person who enjoys traveling\n11. the person who likes grapes is adjacent to the person who enjoys camping (either immediately left or right)\n12. the person who likes spy movies is to the left of the person who enjoys card-games (not necessarily immediately)\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Food\", \"Hobby\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 3 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Hobby: video-games, chess, sudoku, gardening, board-games\n2. Transport: subway, motorbike, taxi, snowmobile, car\n3. Job: musician, dancer, writer, librarian, police-officer\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who uses subway for transportation is a different person than the person who enjoys gardening\n2. the person who uses snowmobile for transportation is to the left of the person who enjoys chess (not necessarily immediately)\n3. the person who enjoys gardening is to the right of the person who enjoys sudoku (not necessarily immediately)\n4. the person who enjoys chess is to the left of the person who uses taxi for transportation (not necessarily immediately)\n5. the person who works as a dancer is to the right of the person who uses taxi for transportation (not necessarily immediately)\n6. the person who works as a musician is to the left of the person who enjoys sudoku (not necessarily immediately)\n7. the person who uses car for transportation is directly between the person who uses subway for transportation and the person who works as a police-officer\n8. the person who works as a dancer is immediately to the left of the person who works as a librarian\n9. the person who uses snowmobile for transportation is adjacent to the person who works as a writer (either immediately left or right)\n10. the person who enjoys board-games is to the right of the person who enjoys video-games (not necessarily immediately)\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Hobby\", \"Job\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 3 unique items:\n\n1. Music: ambient, punk, indie\n2. Food: kiwi, lemon, cucumber\n3. Movie: comedy, fantasy, mystery\n\nEach category has exactly 3 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who likes lemon is adjacent to the person who likes fantasy movies (either immediately left or right)\n2. the person who likes lemon is to the right of the person who likes punk music (not necessarily immediately)\n3. the person who likes ambient music is directly between the person who likes kiwi and the person who likes indie music\n4. the person who likes cucumber is to the right of the person who likes comedy movies (not necessarily immediately)\n5. the person who likes mystery movies is immediately to the right of the person who likes fantasy movies\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Food\", \"Movie\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 3).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Nationality: spanish, egyptian, chinese, brazilian, german\n2. Sport: sailing, rowing, surfing, swimming, ice-hockey\n3. Transport: motorbike, roller, train, helicopter, jet-ski\n4. Beverage: almond-milk, lemonade, water, milk, fanta\n5. Movie: fantasy, satire, family, comedy, scientific\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who likes scientific movies is somewhere

For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 4 unique items:\n\n1. Nationality: indian, pakistani, american, thai\n2. Sport: cricket, surfing, weightlifting, badminton\n3. Movie: zombie, satire, horror, scientific\n4. Job: entrepreneur, doctor, engineer, manager\n\nEach category has exactly 4 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who plays cricket is somewhere between the american person and the person who works as a manager (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n2. the thai person is to the right of the person who likes satire movies (not necessarily immediately)\n3. the person who works as a engineer is immediately to the left of the person who likes zombie movies\n4. the person who works as a entrepreneur is the same person as the person who plays surfing\n5. the american person is immediately to the right of the person who likes horror movies\n6. the person who plays cricket is immediately to the left of the pakistani person\n7. the person who likes horror movies is to the right of the person who plays cricket (not necessarily immediately)\n8. the person who works as a doctor is immediately to the right of the person who plays badminton\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Job\", \"Movie\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 4).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Job: engineer, journalist, coach, mechanic, analyst\n2. Pet: hamster, lizard, ferret, bird, horse\n3. Movie: horror, scientific, fantasy, adventure, sports\n4. Food: cucumber, raspberry, peach, pineapple, garlic\n5. Sport: water-polo, golf, rowing, basketball, cycling\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who plays golf is the same person as at least one of the person who likes cucumber or the person who likes horror movies\n2. the person who works as a analyst is the same person as at least one of the person who has hamster as a pet or the person who plays golf\n3. the person who plays cycling is a different person than the person who likes horror movies or the person who likes horror movies is a different person than the person who likes garlic or both\n4. the person who likes garlic is at the same position as or to the left of the person who works as a journalist\n5. the person who works as a journalist is the same person as at least one of the person who likes peach or the person who plays rowing\n6. the person who likes fantasy movies is at the same position as or to the left of the person who likes raspberry\n7. the

    "question": "You are given an Einstein logic puzzle. In this puzzle, there are 5 people living in the same community. Each person has exactly one attribute from each of 5 different categories (like nationality, pet, drink, etc.). No two people share the same attribute from any category. Your task is to determine which attributes belong to which person based on the given clues. The clues describe relationships between people and their attributes. For example 'the person with the red house is immediately to the left of the person who drinks coffee'. By logically combining all clues, you should be able to determine the complete solution.\n\nSetup:\n\nThe puzzle involves the following categories, each with 5 unique items:\n\n1. Beverage: water, milk, soy-milk, fanta, sprite\n2. Hobby: drawing, cooking, puzzles, singing, writing\n3. Movie: adventure, crime, zombie, time-travel, fantasy\n4. Nationality: brazilian, indonesian, german, russian, egyptian\n5. Pet: fish, lizard, hamster, rabbit, horse\n\nEach category has exactly 5 items, and no item repeats within a category.\n\nClues:\n\n1. the person who likes crime movies and the person who likes milk are at positions with different parity (one at odd, one at even position)\n2. the person who likes fantasy movies is the same person as the person who has lizard as a pet or the egyptian person is the same person as the person who likes fantasy movies, but not both\n3. the person who likes soy-milk is the same person as the person who has horse as a pet or the person who enjoys cooking is the same person as the person who likes soy-milk, but not both\n4. the person who has fish as a pet is the same person as exactly one of the person who likes adventure movies or the brazilian person\n5. the person who likes adventure movies and the person who has hamster as a pet are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n6. the person who enjoys drawing is at the same position as or to the right of the german person\n7. the person who likes adventure movies and the person who likes water are at positions with the same parity (both at odd or both at even positions)\n8. the person who likes crime movies is at an even-numbered position\n9. the person who enjoys writing is at the same position as or to the right of the person who has fish as a pet\n10. the german person is at the same position as or to the left of the person who likes water\n11. the person who likes milk is the same person as the person who has rabbit as a pet or the person who has rabbit as a pet is the same person as the person who likes time-travel movies or both\n12. the person who likes fanta is at the same position as or to the right of the russian person\n13. the person who likes fantasy movies is a different person than at least one of the person who has horse as a pet or the egyptian person\n14. the person who likes water is at the same position as or to the left of the person who likes sprite\n15. the person who likes time-travel movies is at the same position as or to the right of the person who enjoys drawing\n16. the person who has horse as a pet is somewhere between the person who has lizard as a pet and the person who has fish as a pet (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n17. the person who likes time-travel movies is at the same position as or to the left of the german person\n18. the person who likes time-travel movies is to the right of the person who has fish as a pet (not necessarily immediately)\n19. the person who likes zombie movies is at the same position as or to the right of the person who likes fantasy movies\n20. the person who has horse as a pet is at the same position as or to the right of the person who likes water\n21. the person who enjoys puzzles is to the right of the person who has horse as a pet (not necessarily immediately)\n22. the person who enjoys singing is somewhere between the person who enjoys writing and the person who enjoys puzzles (not necessarily immediately adjacent)\n23. the german person is a different person than the person who likes fanta\n\nExpected Output Format:\n\nYour solution should be a dictionary where:\n- Each key is a category name (e.g., \"Beverage\", \"Hobby\").\n- Each value is a list of items, ordered by position from left to right (position 1 to position 5).\n- Each item in a category must appear exactly once.\n",
